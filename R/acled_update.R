#' @title Updating your ACLED dataset
#' @name acled_update
#' @description
#' This function is meant to help you keep your dataset updated, by automatically checking for new and modified events, as well as deleted events (if deleted = TRUE).
#' Note: The function makes new API calls to gather new and modified events.
#' @param df The dataframe to update, it has to have the same structure as ACLED's dyadic dataframe (i.e. the result of `acled_api()`)
#' @param start_date The first date of events you want to update from.. These are the celling and floor of *event_date*, not of *timestamp*.
#' @param end_date The last date of events you want to update from. These are the celling and floor of *event_date*, not of *timestamp*.
#' @param additional_countries string. Additional additional_countries to update your dataset. It defaults to “current countries”, which includes all the additional_countries inside your dataset.
#' @param regions string. The regions for which you would like events in your dataset updated.
#' @param event_types string. The event types for which you would like events in your dataset updated.
#' @param email character string. Email associated with your ACLED account registered at <https://acleddata.com/>.
#' @param password character string. The password associated with your ACLED account. If NULL, you will be prompted to enter your password interactively.
#' @param key character string. Access key associated with your ACLED account registered at <https://acleddata.com/>  (deprecated).
#' @param acled_access logical. If TRUE (default), you have used the acled_access function and the email and key arguments are not required (deprecated).
#' @param deleted logical. If TRUE (default), the function will also remove deleted events using acled_deletions_api().
#' @param inter_numeric logical. If FALSE (default), interaction code columns (inter1, inter2, and interaction) returned as strings describing the actor types/interactions. If TRUE, the values are returned as numeric values. Must match the inter type (numeric or string) in the dataframe being updated.
#' @param prompts logical. If TRUE (default), users will receive an interactive prompt providing information about their call (additional_countries requested, number of country-days, and number of API calls required) and asking if they want to proceed with the call. If FALSE, the call continues without warning, but the call is split and returns a message specifying how many calls are being made.
#' @return Tibble with updated ACLED data and a newer timestamp.
